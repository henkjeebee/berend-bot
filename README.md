## A chatbot created with Watson Assistant on IBM Cloud

To use these files, you need an account on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) and an instance of Watson Assistant. This is a work in progress, building a dialog tree with intents and entities created specifically for the custom content of [Technology Evolution Insights](https://techevo.nl/custom). This is unfinished work, consisting mainly of JSON-files of specificic trees and skills.
